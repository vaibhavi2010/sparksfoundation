        <p>1 in 11 children go to work when they should be in school. When it is hard to afford necessities like food, shelter, and clothing; education becomes a luxury that the poor give up. Illiteracy then leads to further poverty. Donate for child education in India, support them with fees, school supplies, footwear, transport and opportunities to showcase their talents.</p>

            <p><b>Gangamma’s parents were uneducated and had a hand-to-mouth existence, but they always had big dreams for their daughter. And Gangamma persevered. She completed her early schooling in a Government upper primary school close to her home. But unfortunately, it was not a very good school and there weren’t any other schools in her village. So she took a transfer to the Hukumpeta Government high school, that required her to walk for two hours every day through hilly and rocky terrain. For her family who had never been outside the village, Gangamma’s going to another village for studies was a big deal for Gangamma’s family, who themselves had never stepped outside their village.</b></p>

            <p><b>Village Gondivalasa  is inhabited by a primitive tribal group (the most backward tribal group). In this village, lives Tangula Gurubari, a 10 year old Nanhi Kali, studying in class 4. She comes from a very poor family, with 2 brothers and a sister and her parents are illiterate. The main sources of income for the family are from the forest (Non Timber Forest products) and daily labour. Tangula is very  active and fares well in studies and extracurricular activities. In fact, she has been selected as the leader of Library club in her school. Tangula loves reading books and motivates her friends to read too.Tangula aspires to study further and become a teacher and impart knowledge among children!</b></p>

            <p> <b>She and her family belonged to the remote village of Bhader in Kotra Block in Udaipur which can only be reached through a 6 km trek on a rickety road.Her parents, both agricultural daily labourers earned just enough to put two square meals before the 6-member family. With the youngest girl child already a school dropout in class 7, there were chances that Sunita would also be forced to drop out of school to work and supplement the insufficient family income.Going to school for Sunita, was like a race with incessant hurdles. The school was 16 kms. away from her village and she often had to use 2-3 modes of travel to get there. School authorities did not pardon her for being occasionally late and being reprimanded in front of other classmates was even more humiliating. Household chores left her with little time and energy to revise what she was taught in school or prepare for the next day’s teachings.</b></p>

Tokure Sanyasamma, D/O Lochayya is studying in class 3. She is 12 years old. Her parents are illiterate and addicted to alcohol. Tokure had also become a victim of it and was forced to discontinue her studies. Sponsorship under Project Nanhi Kali did not change the attitudeof her parents as they wanted to get her married. However with the intervention of her school teacher, Naandi field personnel and other members in the community, her parents were counseled and at the last minute her marriage was postponed. Now, Tokure is back in school, studying in class 4.</b></p>
